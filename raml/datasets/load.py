        2. Total payment for all claims in thousands of Swedish Kronor.
    
    The baseline performance of predicting the mean value is an RMSE of approximately 81 thousand Kronor.

def Pima_Indians_Diabetes():
    '''The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset involves predicting the onset of diabetes 
    within 5 years in Pima Indians given medical details.

    It is a binary (2-class) classification problem. The number of observations for 
    each class is not balanced. There are 768 observations with 8 input variables 
    and 1 output variable. Missing values are believed to be encoded with zero values.

    The baseline performance of predicting the most prevalent class is a classification 
    accuracy of approximately 65%. Top results achieve 77% accuracy.

    Columns:
        1. Number of times pregnant.
        2. Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
        3. Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
        4. Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
        5. 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
        6. Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
        7. Diabetes pedigree function.
        8. Age (years).
        9. Class variable (0 or 1).
